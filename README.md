GA-B85M-DS3H, i5-4460, GTX 1060 - OpenCore EFI folder for macOS Monterey

[Nvidia drivers for MacOS Mojave and newer](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/webdrv-kext-consent)

Not working:
  - Audio (Add a kext, I use a bluetooth headset so I didn't need it)
  - Apps that use the Metal API (Chromium and everything based on it for example)
